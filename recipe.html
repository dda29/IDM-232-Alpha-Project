                <figcaption>In this easy recipe, inspired by steak Diane (an American restaurant classic),
                     weʼre searing beef medallions, then using the fond in the pan to make a rich, 
                     bright mushroom sauce for spooning on top. Garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed kale 
                     make for delicious, simple sides.</figcaption>

            <h2>Step One. Prepare the Ingredients</h2>
            <p>Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high.
                Wash and dry the fresh produce. 
                Large dice the potatoes. Peel the garlic. 
                Using the flat side of your knife, smash 1 clove to flatten. 
                Roughly chop the remaining clove. 
                Peel and thinly slice the shallot. 
                Remove and discard the stems of the kale; 
                roughly chop the leaves. Thinly slice the mushrooms.</p>

            <h2>Step Two. Cook and Mash the Potatoes</h2>
            <p>
            Add the diced potatoes and smashed garlic to the pot of boiling water
             and cook 13 to 15 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. 
             Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot. 
             Add half the butter and a drizzle of olive oil. Using a fork, 
             mash to your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to 
             taste. Cover to keep warm.

            <h2>Step Three. Adding Shallots and Kale</h2>
            <p>
            While the potatoes cook, in a large pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil
             on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced shallot; season with salt and pepper. 
             Cook, stirring occasionally, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened. 
             Add the chopped kale and 1/4 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. 
             Cook, stirring frequently, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the kale has wilted 
             and the water has cooked off. Transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper 
             to taste. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Rinse and wipe out the pan.

            <h2>Step Four. Cooking Beef Medallions</h2>
            <p>
            While the potatoes continue to cook, pat the beef dry with paper towels. 
            Season with salt and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 1 tablespoon
         of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned beef and cook 2 to 3 minutes
          per side for medium-rare, or until browned and cooked to your desired degree of doneness. 
          Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate and let rest for at least 5 minutes.

            <h2>Step Five. Make the Mushroom Sauce</h2>
            <p>
            While the beef rests, add a drizzle of olive oil 
            to the pan of reserved fond and heat on medium-high until hot. 
            Add the sliced mushrooms in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, 
            or until browned. Add the chopped garlic; season with salt and pepper. 
            Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened and fragrant. 
            Add the mustard, verjus, and 2 tablespoons of water (be careful, as the liquid may splatter);
            season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently and scraping up any fond, 30 seconds to
            1 minute, or until thoroughly combined. Turn off the heat and stir in the remaining butter until melted. 
            (If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add up to 2 tablespoons of water to achieve your desired consistency.) 
            Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </p>

            <h2>Step Six. Serve dinner</h2>
            <p>
            Serve the rested beef with the mashed potatoes and cooked kale. 
            Top the beef and potatoes with the mushroom sauce. Enjoy!
